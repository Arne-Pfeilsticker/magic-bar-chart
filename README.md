# Magic Bar Chart (Chiasm, AngularJS + Material Design)

The starting point for this project is Curran's [Magic Bar Chart (angularjs UI)](http://bl.ocks.org/curran/b6e1d23c16dc76371a92) [chiasm](https://github.com/chiasm-project/chiasm) example.

The aim of this example is:
* To replace Bootstrap with [Material Design](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/). (done)
* To show several bar charts at the same time.
* To place the bar charts into different Materials Design [flexboxes](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/layout/container).
